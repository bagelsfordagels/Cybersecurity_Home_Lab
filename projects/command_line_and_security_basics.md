# Updating System

## 1.) When first starting the Ubuntu virtual machine I checked to see what updates from the apt package manager can be applied.

## 2.) Next I updated and upgraded my Ubuntu install then rebooted the system.

# User Management

## 1.) I switched to the root user to execute root commands without having to enter my password each time. You can see the terimal changed and has a # instead of a $.

## 2.) Next, I created two users. One with the useradd command and one with the adduser command.

As you can see the adduser command has extra functionality and allows for a more complete user setup.
